"Wednesday, March 1, 2023",4,"I am a 5th-grade Dual Immersion Spanish teacher.     Your collection in Spanish is very limited and most of the books are for lower elementary.    Most of my students read at 6.5 - 8.5 reading levels in Spanish, and 4.5 -6.5 in English.     It is challenging to find a diverse collection of books at those levels in Spanish.     I have found many good books in Mexico, but not AR, and our school is all about AR points.     I am looking forward to seeing your collection grow.     Also, at a conference I mentioned to the representative to be careful with Chespirito and El Chavo del Ocho. I am very familiar with that show and the preservation of bullying of the rich kid ""Kiko"" towards el Chavo and all other characters that his mother and he belittle and insult in many ways.

3/1/2023 12:17,2," I submit all of the orders for P-BVUSD. There are too many emails for submitting different orders, so some are never processed. (sometimes even if they ARE send to the appropriate email) and then we have to reach out and re-send, and a month or so has gone by so the subscriptions the teachers order expire, therefore order has to be changed or that item is cancelled. Also when the magazines are delivered, they are clumped up with several orders combined, and the magazines go to different schools sites, so they either have to be sorted by our mail room (instead of being sent separately by Purchase Order from Scholastic) or there's no name on the magazine so it just sits in our warehouse until months go by and a site asks about it. It would be great if there was a central email for Scholastic to purchase orders, so that on Scholastic's side all emails can be forwarded to appropriate departments on Scholastics side. And it would be great if every purchase order is delivered separately with the Purchase Order number printed on each bundle.
